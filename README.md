Python project from the 
book python crash course
ALIEN Invasion
Step 1:
 Creating a window:
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
Initially, we need to introduce pygame library and afterward import the library in 
alien_invasion.py. Presently begin creating a game. Make a capacity pygame.init. 
This strategy is utilized to make foundation settings. Also, we utilized 
pygame.display.set_mode to make the screen show. After that, we set the 
tallness and width of the screen to be shown. At that point, we utilized while 
circle and for circle. We made for the occasion which helps the player or client to 
a remarkable game.
 Setting the bg-color:
Pygame makes a dark screen naturally that is the reason we changed the tone by 
utilizing bg_color strategy. After that we use screen.fill (bg_color) to make the 
screen obvious.
 OUTPUT:
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
make another python record settings.py. Use class settings and added screen 
width, heigth and bg coloe tone.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
Import settings in main program and store this in ai_settings. Now 
ai_settings.bg_color used to fill the background screen.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
Now, create a new python file name ship. In ship.py we used the class ship. In this 
class we created init function. After that we downloaded the ship image and used 
it. To extract the image from exact location we used image.rect method. Image 
appears at the bottom center of the screen. Secondly, we create a function blit. 
To update the screen.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In main program we import a ship.py file and its method.
OUTPUT:
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
We create a new python file name game_function. in this file we created a new 
function called check events. In the function copy a for loop. Its already declare in 
a main program.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a main program we import a game function file. and access its library by the 
help of gf method. In while loop we us gf.check events and remove a for loop 
path.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In game function file we create a new function name update screen. And copy a 
method. Its already declare in main function.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
Now, in main program we use update function and remove method which we 
declared in while loop because it is already declare in update function.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
We modify our program. In a game function file, we modify a check event 
function () and add ship in parameter. In check event function we add 
pygame.keydown. when user press right so ship move to right.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In this step we added ship check event parameter in a main program.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a ship.py file we created update function () and we declare it when the user 
pressed right key the flag is true and the ship moves after that we added flag in a 
init function 
In a game function, we modified check event function. In this function we create 
another elif block. In this block we use pygame.keyup so that when the user stop 
pressing a key the flag is flag is false.
In a main program we create a ship update method.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In ship.py file. We modify update function, it is same as we done above when the 
user press the left key the ship moves left.
In a game function file we add pygame.leftkey in a check down block. Same 
process we did for right key.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In settings.py file we added ship speed.
Now, we added new things in ship file. Rect.centerx method is use to control the
position of a ship. Self. Center adjust amount of speed.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a main program we added ship to control speed.
In ship.py file. We added some new command line in update function. These line 
use to stop the ship when it moves right and touches the corner. Same process 
we done for left key.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a game function file we created two functions key up and key down. And in key 
down we write the same lines which declare in elif key down block. Same process 
will be done for keyup.
 
Now we have to add some bullets and it speed thatâ€™s why we write new lines in 
settings.py file. And set its width, height and color.
Create a new file name bullet and in this file we import a sprite library to 
generate bullet. After that we created a class bullet. And in this class we added
init function.in this function we added a bullet color, bullet position and height.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In the same file we created two function update and draw bullet. Update function 
mange a bullet speed. We set the bullet traveling direction as .y coordinate which
means bullet will travel in vertical position.
In Second function we draw a bullet on the screen and set its color and position.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a main program, we imported spirit library and secondly we added a 
group of bullets.
Also added the bullet on update screen.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a game function.py file we created elif. And also we added a pygame. K space
and added bullet, which means that when a user press enter the bullet release in 
ship.
In this step, we added a bullet variable in a check keydown parameters. Also In 
check keyup.
In the main function. We enter a condition in while loop. This condition is for the 
bullet to disappear, when reaches the top of the screen.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a setting function. We added bullets limit, which mean how many bullets will 
release at a time.
In a game function. We added a line in a K space. To fix a number of bullet release 
in a ship.
In a game function we created a new function name update_bullets and from this 
function we copied for loop in a main program.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In main program we added update bullets function.
In a game function file. We created a fire bullet function. This function is used, 
when a user presses the space bar the bullets will appear on the screen. In check 
key down function () we call a function fire bullet. 
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a game function file. We added a pygame.K_q method call in a pygame. 
Keydown.pygame.k_q, it used when the user press Q the game is exit.
Now create alien file. In this file we added class alien and in this class we add 
function name init. And in this function we added lines. To add alien image same 
process as we did for ship image and set alien width, height. While Second 
function used for image and setting load.
Huzaifa Niaz PF Ass 3 20B-089-SE
In a main program we import alien file. And in the function we call alien setting. 
After that we added alien in update screen.
